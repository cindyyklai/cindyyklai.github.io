I have been using Terminal for years but I always found it annoying to have to move the cursor one character at a time to get to the desired position. I heard about iTerm and MouseTerm but I did not want to install any additional programs in my system (Mac OS X) where I would probably use 1% (or less) of the available features. And today I found the solution! Just press the Alt key and click on the desired position! How handy is that.
