For those of you who are new to AngularJS and would like to get a kick start on it, [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) offers a free online course called [Shaping up with Angular.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js).  The course is arranged into five levels.  Each level contains challenges that help to get grip of things explained in the video.  The course is very clear and well organized.  Highly recommended!

Here&#8217;s my [very first AngularJS project](https://github.com/cindyyklai/Angularjs-Flatlanders-Gem-Store)!
