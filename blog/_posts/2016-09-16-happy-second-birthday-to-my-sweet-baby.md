My youngest one has been into owls lately. I found some really cool pictures of owls cakes on Pinterest and they don&#8217;t look too terribly hard to make so I decided to give it a try. Also this time I tried something new &#8211; wrapping the cake with modeling chocolate. In the past, I&#8217;d always been just making decorations with modeling chocolate and had never tried covering an entire cake with it. After much research, I concluded that it can be done but not in the same way as one would use fondant (Though I have not used fondant myself, just don&#8217;t find it very appealing &#8211; taste wise :)). I cut a big slab of modeling chocolate to cover the side and a circle on the top, then rub the seams using the heat from my hand to blend them.

There were some areas on the side and on the tops (mostly around the edge) that were not as smooth as I would like. I added some tiny flowers to the top to conceal those rough areas but I did not want to add any more things to the side as I wanted the number thingy in the middle to stand out.
