Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin),

> &#8230; a mixin is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. &#8230;
> 
> &#8230; Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause, or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods.
