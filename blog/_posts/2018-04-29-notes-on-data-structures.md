Queue

Stack

Heap
  
&#8211; max-heap &#8211; all children are smaller than parent
  
&#8211; min-heap &#8211; all children are greater than parent
  
&#8211; Time complexity for insertion is O(logN)
  
&#8211; Heapsort => O(NlogN)

Binary Tree
  
&#8211; always of height logN

Sorting
  
&#8211; insertion sort
  
&#8211; bubble sort

Hash table
  
O(1)
