For sometime, I was confused about how node.js differs from other javascript frameworks.  I thought it was just ANOTHER framework.  Today I decided to clear it up, so I did a little bit of research myself, and here&#8217;s what I learned:

Node.js is a command-line tool that runs JavaScript on a machine without needing to run in a browser. It does this by using a version of [Chrome’s V8 Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)), which is the JavaScript engine that runs inside Google Chrome.

In other words, node.js is not for front end development, it&#8217;s actually a **server-side javascript** language
