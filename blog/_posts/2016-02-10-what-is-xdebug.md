I have been using Xdebug (which I installed in PhpStorm) to debug my code, and it has been one of my indispensable tools for coding. It was quite a pain to set it up, but once you get it up and running, it actually is a big time saver when debugging code.

So, what is Xdebug? In a nutshell, it is a PHP extension that allows you to set breakpoints in your script. When you execute the script, it will pause at those breakpoints and Xdebug will display the variables and objects as well as their values at that exact point. So, you don&#8217;t need to add echo, print\_r() or var\_dump() to your code to debug anymore!
