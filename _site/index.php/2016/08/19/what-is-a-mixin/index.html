<blockquote>
  <p>… a mixin is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. …</p>

  <p>… Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause, or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods.</p>
