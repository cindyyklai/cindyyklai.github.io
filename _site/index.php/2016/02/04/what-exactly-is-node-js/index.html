<p>For sometime, I was confused about how node.js differs from other javascript frameworks.  I thought it was just ANOTHER framework.  Today I decided to clear it up, so I did a little bit of research myself, and here’s what I learned:</p>

<p>Node.js is a command-line tool that runs JavaScript on a machine without needing to run in a browser. It does this by using a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">Chrome’s V8 Engine</a>, which is the JavaScript engine that runs inside Google Chrome.</p>

<p>In other words, node.js is not for front end development, it’s actually a <strong>server-side javascript</strong> language</p>

<p> </p>
