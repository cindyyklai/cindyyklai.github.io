<p>Recently I was helping a coworker to set up his drush and we ran into this problem:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">Drush was not able to start (bootstrap) the Drupal [error]
database.
</pre>

<p>After hours of troubleshooting, I added these lines to his .bash_profile, as suggested by this this post:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">export PATH="/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5.5.10/bin:$PATH"

export PATH
export DRUSH_PHP="/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/bin/php"
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p>And voila, itâ€™s working!</p>
