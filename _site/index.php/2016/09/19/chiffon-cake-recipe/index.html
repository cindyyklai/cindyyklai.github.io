<p>This is my all-time favorite recipe for chiffon cake.  It is super moist, light and fluffy.  I adapted the recipe from <a href="http://candey.blog.sohu.com/26243870.html" target="_blank">this site</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Judyhandmadecake/" target="_blank">Judy’s Hand Made Cakes</a>.  I have served it plain for breakfast or snack, or iced it with whipped cream.  This recipe makes two 8-inch round cakes or one 9×3 cake.  Please make sure not to use nonstick pans as they will prevent the cake from rising properly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sugar 100g + little bit of corn starch</li>
  <li>Cake flour 120g</li>
  <li>Egg white 10</li>
  <li>Egg yolk 10</li>
  <li>Milk 83g</li>
  <li>Cooking oil 75g</li>
  <li>Baking powder 1/4 teaspoon (optional)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven at 350F.</li>
  <li>Pour milk and cooking oil (Any kind of oil will do – Olive, Grape seed or regular cooking oil) into a microwave safe container and warm it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds.</li>
  <li>Whisk the milk and oil until mixed.</li>
  <li>Add sifted cake flour to the milk+oil mixture and mix until smooth.  </li>
  <li>Add egg yolks to the cake mixture gently but quickly until well incorporated. Put aside.</li>
  <li>Beat egg whites in a clean bowl (Very important – the bowl must not have any oil) until frothy.</li>
  <li>Add 1/3 of the sugar to the egg whites and beat for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Add half of the remaining sugar to the egg whites and beat for about 1 minute.</li>
  <li>Add the remaining sugar to egg whites and beat until stiff peaks have formed (At this stage, it is known as meringue).  The egg whites will not drip or fall when you invert the bowl.</li>
  <li>Using a spatula, fold 1/3 of the meringue into the yolk batter quickly and gently.  Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl and that the batter is evenly mixed.</li>
  <li>Pour the batter into the remaining meringue and mix well.</li>
  <li>Pour the batter into the cake pan(s) and bake according to the type of pans used.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>8-in round pans – 350F for 15 min, 320F for 20 min, 305 for 5 min.</li>
  <li>9×13 pan – 350F for 12 min, 330 for 10 min, 300 for 10 min.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Once the cake is done, invert to a metal rack and let cool before serving.</li>
</ol>
