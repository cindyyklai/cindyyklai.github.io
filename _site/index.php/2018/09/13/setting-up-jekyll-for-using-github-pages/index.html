<p>So, I have been using WordPress as my personal blogging tool. I don’t need any fancy stuff or lots of customizations for my site as all I would like to do is to document what I’ve learned and share with others. In this aspect, an out-of-the-box WordPress site with a few plugins works great for me. However, when I heard about GitHub Pages, I couldn’t wait to try it. Why? Because it is free. Take a look at this bill from my hosting company this year:</p>

<p><img src="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail.png" alt="" width="616" height="269" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-658" srcset="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail.png 616w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></p>

<p>To most people, $143 is not a lot of money. However, I can’t justify spending over $100 on a very basic site every year when there is a free alternative. Moreover, this fee goes up every year! Look at how much it was last year:</p>

<p><img src="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail.png" alt="" width="612" height="329" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-659" srcset="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail.png 612w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7_days_left_until_service_expiration_-_cindy_yk_lai_gmail_com_-_Gmail-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>

<p>While I will pay to keep my domain, it doesn’t make sense for me to continue with the hosting service. I am motivated/determined to get my WordPress site migrated to GitHub before the hosting service expires!</p>

<p>I’ve also decided to document my journey of setting up Jekyll and using it as a blogging tool on my GitHub site. So here you go!</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites--ruby-and-jekyll">Prerequisites – Ruby and Jekyll</h1>

<p>Per the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll official website</a>, Jekyll requires Ruby version 2.2.5 or above.</p>

<p>I had to update my Ruby as the version shipped with my Mac OS definitely did not meet this requirement.</p>

<pre>[515] cindylai@MacBook-Pro-201 - 03:28:10 $ ruby -v
ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-darwin14]</pre>

<p>So, I tried:</p>

<pre>rvm install ruby-2.5.1</pre>

<p>And got this message:</p>

<pre>Warning! PATH is not properly set up, /Users/cindylai/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.2/bin is not at first place.
         Usually this is caused by shell initialization files. Search for PATH=... entries.
         You can also re-add RVM to your profile by running: rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles
         To fix it temporarily in this shell session run: rvm use ruby-2.2.2
         To ignore this error add rvm_silence_path_mismatch_check_flag=1 to your ~/.rvmrc file.
Already installed ruby-2.5.1.
To reinstall use:

    rvm reinstall ruby-2.5.1
</pre>

<p>Well, at least there are instructions on how to fix it. To reload RVM, simply do:</p>

<pre>rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles</pre>

<p>And now, the following confirms that I’m on the latest version:</p>

<pre>[525] cindylai@MacBook-Pro-201 - 03:33:46 $ ruby -v
ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-darwin17]</pre>

<p>I then proceeded to install Jekyll and bundler gems:</p>

<pre>gem install jekyll bundler</pre>

<h1 id="creating-a-new-jekyll-site">Creating a new Jekyll site</h1>

<p>At this point, I thought I was done with all the set up and ready to create my Jekyll site, so I did:</p>

<pre>jekyll new myblog</pre>

<p>And of course, it didn’t go as planned. This is what it returned:</p>

<pre>/Users/cindylai/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.1/gems/bundler-1.16.4/lib/bundler/resolver.rb:285:in `block in verify_gemfile_dependencies_are_found!': Could not find gem 'github-pages' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile. (Bundler::GemNotFound)

</pre>

<p>This time Ruby didn’t tell me how to fix it, but I found a <a href="https://blog.mattclemente.com/2016/02/24/getting-started-with-jekyll-part-3.html">helpful answer</a> , which is to run:</p>

<pre>bundle install</pre>

<p>After that, Ruby successfully installed Jekyll and other dependencies from the GitHub Pages gem.</p>

<p>Now, I ran</p>

<pre>jekyll new myblog</pre>

<p>again and this time it worked.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-649" src="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/myblog-1024x264.png" alt="" width="600" height="155" srcset="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/myblog-1024x264.png 1024w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/myblog-300x77.png 300w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/myblog-768x198.png 768w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/myblog.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>Next, I ran:</p>

<pre>bundle exec jekyll serve</pre>

<p>Jekyll successfully served up my blog but there are a couple of warnings:</p>

<pre>Configuration file: none

<p>Upon googling this issue, I stumbled across https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6047. And based on one of the comments, this seems to be expected starting Jekyll 3.2. This is the statement on the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">Jekyll official site</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Directory_Structure___Jekyll_•_Simple__blog-aware__static_sites.png" alt="" width="733" height="245" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-679" srcset="http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Directory_Structure___Jekyll_•_Simple__blog-aware__static_sites.png 733w, http://cindylai.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Directory_Structure___Jekyll_•_Simple__blog-aware__static_sites-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>

<p>And I confirm that I’m on 3.7.4:</p>

<pre>[536] cindylai@MacBook-Pro-201 - 08:54:44 $ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.7.4
</pre>
